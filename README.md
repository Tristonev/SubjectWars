# Subject-Wars
Our game is a 2d, side-scrolling, tower defense, battle simulator. The idea is to have different subjects fight each other. 

IMPORTANT: Before you read any further, please download the latest game version within the 'Executable' folder. The latest version will be listed as 'SWPrototype' followed by the version number. Please note that our project has been ONLY optimized for windows machines, and will not execute properly on linux, mac, or any other operating system! If you are in need of an executable that uses a different operating system, please contact the team at subjectwars6@gmail.com.

1.) Unzip the folder that you downloaded from the 'Executable' folder

2.) Within the unzipped folder, there should be a sub folder that contains an executable file. It will be named SubjectWars.exe, or just SubjectWars

3.) Execute the executable file, and this will start the game

4.) You, the player will start off in the main menu. You will be given the options to play, quit, or login

5.) To play, click on the play button. This will transport you to the base level.

6.) There also exists a How-To-Play button within the main menu, however if you do not understand it, here is an in-depth explanation on how to play:

    - There are a couple UI elements to notice:
    
        - The 'unit' buttons will spawn units that fight for you. These units will cost the 'gold star' currency
        
        - The 'gold star' currency UI element gives you information on how much currency you have to spawn the units needed
        
        - The 'gold star' currency recharges over time, and there is a 'gold star' currency tied to each unit in the game
        
7.) The goal is to destroy the enemy tower on the other side using the friendly units that you spawned
