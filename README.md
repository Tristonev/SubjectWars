# Subject-Wars
Our game is a 2d, side-scrolling, tower defense, battle simulator. The idea is to have different subjects fight each other. 

IMPORTANT: Before you read any further, please download the latest game version within the 'Executable' folder. The latest version will be listed as 'SWPrototype' followed by the version number. 

- Unzip the folder that you downloaded from the 'Executable' folder
- Within the unzipped folder, there should be a sub folder that contains an executable file
- Execute the executable file, and this will start the game
- You, the player will start off in the main menu. You will be given the options to play or quit
- To play, click on the play button. This will transport you to the base level.
- There are a couple UI elements to notice:
    - The 'unit' buttons will spawn units that fight for you. These units will cost the 'gold star' currency
    - The 'gold star' currency UI element gives you information on how much currency you have to spawn the units          needed
- Spawn any number of units with the 'gold star' currency. The currency will recharge over time, allowing you to      spawn more and more friendly units
- The goal is to destroy the enemy tower on the other side using the friendly units that you spawned
